# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
A "controller" handles requests in a web application. When someone asks for a specific page or data, the controller figures out what to do with that request.

Yes! To be more specific, a controller is a **function**. And what it figures out is what to do with the request and **how to respond**
