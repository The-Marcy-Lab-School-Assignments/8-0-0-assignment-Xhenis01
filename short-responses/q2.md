# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint?

# Answer
An "endpoint" is like a specific address for a website . It's where you go to get or do something.
It's just a way for your computer or phone to find and interact with the right part of a website or web service.

Yeah this is the right idea but I think you can be more specific. Think about the endpoints in your own server. Each one provides a way for the client to access a specific resource (whether its data or HTML content). I definitely think your explanation covers this, but you could add some extra flavor.
